# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify 0x329eb787fd15E0733fc5F8c2371F8365de2AA1Ff 0x488D03966188487Bd1D65C863f07b298E7871282 10000000000000000000 7536703 --network moonbase  
```
